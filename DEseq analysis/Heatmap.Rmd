This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
```
```{r}
library("BiocManager")
library("ComplexHeatmap")
library("grid")
```


```{r}
corrData <- read.csv('/Users/shanghongsim/Documents/GitHub/HU-ATRi-Code-Repository/r values AOS-genes-screen.csv', header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#set specific column as row names
rownames(corrData) <- corrData$database

#remove original column from data frame
corrData$database <- NULL
```

```{r}
corrMat <- data.matrix(corrData)
```


```{r}
Heatmap(corrMat, cluster_rows = FALSE, column_title = "Antioxidant gene signature (41 genes)", 
    column_title_side = "bottom")
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
